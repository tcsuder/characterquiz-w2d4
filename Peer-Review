Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?

Yes, the README file looks fantastic!!

Is the code easy to read (good indentation, spacing, naming)?

yes, this all looks good :)

Were branching and looping used effectively?

Awesome execution on the branching. No looping was used, but could be added to make you have to make less variables.

Is the web page(s) styled using Bootstrap and CSS?

Yes on Bootstrap, not too much CSS. 

Is the site user-friendly?

Yes! You can easily take the quiz, the main function of the site.

Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?

Nope! We think the radio buttons was a tough element to execute, well done friends !
